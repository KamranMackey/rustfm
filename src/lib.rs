//! Welcome to `lastfm_rs`, a Rust library for interacting with the Last.fm API.
//!
//! This library aims to be easy to work with, as well as having complete support for the majority of the
//! Last.fm API endpoints. However, at this time, only a few API endpoints are supported by the library. These
//! include a few endpoints relating to retrieving user information, such as recent tracks, or general user
//! information retrieval. For all supported API endpoints, please check the Modules section; all API endpoints
//! are organized by data type and/or category as reflected by the [Last.fm API Documentation].
//!
//! However, it should be noted that the Scrobbling API is not planned to be implemented in the near future,
//! as music / media players written in Rust are fairly uncommon at this time, meaning support for scrobbling
//! is not currently a high priority for the library. This can always change however, but the main focus is
//! being as robust a library as possible for working with the heavily data-driven Last.fm API endpoints.
//!
//! The `error` and `model` modules are only used for error handling and models that are used across several
//! API endpoints, so they can be ignored, unless you intend on implementing error handling in your application,
//! in which case the error module should be looked at as the module has support for all of Last.fm's error types.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! lastfm_rs is very easy to install into a project; just add the following to the `[dependencies]`
//! section of your `Cargo.toml` file in your project's main directory.
//!
//! ```toml
//! lastfm_rs = "0.4"
//! ```
//!
